      I am originally from Venezuela but have lived in the Phoenix Metro area since 2005. 
      I have a Bachelor of Science in Justice Studies from ASU and though I loved earning my degree, 
      it has not provided too many concrete opportunities to do the type of work I am interested in. 
      I decided to learn to code to put myself on a path towards a career that really works for me.

      Currently, I am working as a remote service specialist for State Farm agents in Arizona and New Mexico.
      I handle routine tasks such as late payment reminders and document/information requests. I love my 
      job because it allows me the opportunity to work from home but the repetitive nature of it makes it 
      unlikely I will be able to continue this work for years to come.

      In my spare time I love to do yoga, craft, read, and binge streamable content. I also spend a lot of time 
      with my adorable dog child, Scarlet. She is a three-year old German Shepherd who is both a major pain in 
      the butt and my favorite creature alive.
